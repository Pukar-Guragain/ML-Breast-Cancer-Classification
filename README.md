# Problem Statement:
Predict whether a breast tissue sample is malignant or benign based on its features
# Motivation:
Early and accurate breast cancer detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.
# Methodology: 
Applied Logistic Regression using scikit-learn on the Breast Cancer dataset for binary classification.
# Results: 
Achieved high classification accuracy with effective separation between malignant and benign samples.
# Conclusions: 
Logistic Regression provides a simple yet powerful baseline model for breast cancer prediction tasks.
